### How to file a bug report
Please if you have any idea on any improvements please do not hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/zerodayz/citellus/issues/new).

### Future plans

The goal is to have a tool which collects all the rules across OpenStack operations.

When someone runs into an issue and fixes it, submits a patch so the next
time a team runs into the same issue can quickly check if there's already known.

We're not targetting just OpenStack, the framework allows to write tests for whatever can be checked with a shell script:
- System management
- Kernel settings
- Performance tunning
- etc

Please, do contribute your plugins for checking against new issues.
